# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project is about a Real-Time chat web (like Slack).
On the server side it uses Flask, a microframework.
On the client side it uses JavaScript and SocketIO to broadcast messages.
The web have different channels where users can chat, without reloadind the page.
Note: The webpage has a poor design, I know it, but I just like much more to design the structure of the web that the design.

Adding to this, I created an additional feature. It lets the users to make general announcements.
Maybe, if the web is used for a high school project (with the cuarentine), where students have different groups between them.
It may be useful to the professor to make general announcements to them with this feature, instead of sending particular messages.
This feature was born as a problem, in the middle of the project I realized that messages where broadcasted to all channels without distinguish between them,
so I said: "Hey this could be a cool feature to add", and I did it.
